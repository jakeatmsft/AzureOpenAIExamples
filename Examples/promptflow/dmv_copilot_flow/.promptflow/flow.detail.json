It builds upon existing transformer-based text representations and applies smoothness inducing technology and Noise Contrastive Estimation for improved robustness and faster training[doc1]. DTE also offers pretrained models for in-context learning, which can be used to find semantically similar natural language utterances[doc2]. These models can be further finetuned for specific tasks, such as prompt crafting, to enhance the performance of downstream inference models like GPT-3[doc2][doc3][doc4].

DTE also offers pretrained models for in-context learning, which can be used to find semantically similar natural language utterances[doc2]. These models can be further finetuned for specific tasks, such as prompt crafting, to enhance the performance of downstream inference models like GPT-3[doc2][doc3][doc4].

If you received \nnotification that a proposed action is being taken against your driving \nprivilege, you must request a hearing within 10 days of being served or \n14 days from the date the notice is mailed. If you do not make a timely \nrequest, your right to a hearing will be lost. \nThis hearing provides you with an opportunity to be heard before an \naction is taken against your driving privilege. You may also have to \nappear in court for the same reason. Any action taken by the court is \nindependent of the action taken by DMV. ",

You cannot drive if your driving privilege \nis suspended or revoked. \nAs a minor, DMV may take action against your license if you have:\n• One at fault collision or traffic violation conviction: An at fault collision \nmeans you were found responsible.\n• Two at fault collisions, two traffic violation convictions, or one of each: \nYou cannot drive for 30 days unless a licensed adult, at least 25 years \nold, rides with you.\n• Three at fault collisions, three traffic violation convictions, or a \ncombination: Your driving privilege will be suspended for six months. \nYou will be on probation for one year.\n —If you have more at fault collisions or traffic violation convictions \nwhile on probation, your license will be suspended again.\n• A conviction of using alcohol or a controlled substance, or both and \nare 15-20 years old: The court will order DMV to suspend your driving \nprivilege for one year or delay your eligibility to apply for a driver’s \nlicense.\nNOTE : Turning 18 years old does not erase or end existing restrictions, \nsuspensions, or probation sentences.\nAdministrative Hearing\nAdministrative hearings are conducted by DMV. If you received \nnotification that a proposed action is being taken against your driving \nprivilege, you must request a hearing within 10 days of being served or \n14 days from the date the notice is mailed. If you do not make a timely \nrequest, your right to a hearing will be lost. \nThis hearing provides you with an opportunity to be heard before an \naction is taken against your driving privilege. You may also have to \nappear in court for the same reason. Any action taken by the court is \nindependent of the action taken by DMV. \n    doc: azureml://locations/southcentralus/workspaces/a2f597f4-1a31-4e25-9c39-aa7e2d3b6df0/data/vector-index-input-1699309222872/versions/1/2-6-23-LINKS-ADDED-2-Passed-Accessibility-DL-600-R1-2023.pdf\n\n"
