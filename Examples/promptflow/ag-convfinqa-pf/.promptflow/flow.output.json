  "answer": "Sure! Let's continue solving the problem.\n\nSince we have already determined the projected exercise price per share in 2040, we can move on to the next question.\n\nQuestion: If the exercise price per share continues to grow at the same average annual growth rate, what would be the projected exercise price per share in 2050?\n\nTo calculate the projected exercise price per share in 2050, we can use the same formula as before:\n\n\\(\\text{{Projected Price}} = \\text{{Initial Price}} \\times (1 + \\text{{Average Annual Growth Rate}})^{\\text{{Number of Years}}}\\)\n\nIn this case, the initial price is the weighted average exercise price per share in 2007, the average annual growth rate is 0.5569, and the number of years is 43 (from 2007 to 2050).\n\nHere's the code to calculate the projected exercise price per share in 2050:\n\n```python\nnumber_of_years = 43\n\nprojected_price_2050 = weighted_average_2007 * (1 + average_annual_growth_rate) ** number_of_years\n\nprint(\"The projected exercise price per share in 2050 would be $\", projected_price_2050)\n```\n\nPlease execute the code to get the answer."
