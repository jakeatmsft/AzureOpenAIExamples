I'm currently living in Los Angeles, but I'm planning to move to Las Vegas and I would like to apply for a loan. OK, I see you're living in California. Let me make sure I understand you correctly. Uh, you'd like to apply for a loan, even though you'll be moving soon, is that right? Yes, exactly. So I'm planning to relocate soon, but I would like to apply for the loan first so that I can purchase a new home once I move there. And are you planning to sell your current home? Yes, I will be listing it on the market soon and hopefully it'll sell quickly. That's why I'm applying for a loan now so that I can purchase a new house in Nevada and close on it quickly as well once my current home sells. I see. Um, would you mind holding for a moment while I take your information down? Yeah, no problem. Thank you for your help. One moment. Alright, thank you for your patience, ma'am. Uh, may I have your first and last name please? Yes, my name is Mary Smith. Thank you, Miss Smith. May I have your current address please? Yes, so my address is 123 Main St in Los Angeles, CA and the ZIP code is 90923. Sorry, that was a 90. What? 90923. 90923 on Main Street. Got it. Thank you. Uh, may I have your phone number as well, please? Yes, my phone number is 504. 5292351 and then? 51. Got it. Um and uh, do you have an e-mail address? Um, we I can associate with this application? Uh, yes. So my e-mail address is mary.a.sm78@gmail.com. Mary dot a. Was that a SN as in November or M as in Mike? Uh, M as in Mike. Like 78? Uh, got it. Right. Thank you, Miss Smith. Um, do you currently have any other loans? Uh, yes. So I currently have two other loans through CONTOSO. Uh, so my first one is my car loan and then my other is my student loan. Uh. They total about 1400 per month combined and my interest rate is 8%. I see. And you're currently paying those loans off monthly, is that right? Yes, of course I do. OK, thank you. Umm, here's what I suggest we do. Uh, let me place you on a brief hold again so I can talk with one of my loan officers and get this started for you immediately. And in the meantime, uh would be great if you could take a few minutes and complete the remainder of the secure application online at www.contosoloans.com. Yeah, that sounds good. I can go ahead and get started. Thank you for your help. Thank you."
